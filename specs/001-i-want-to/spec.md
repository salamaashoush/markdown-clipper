# Feature Specification: Copy as Markdown Chrome Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Complete
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a chrome extension that copy page content as a well formatted markdown file or download it, it should have some good features and good ux the goal is to be able to copy some pages conenet ethier ssr or csr rendered as markdown so llms can read the contents, I want it to have a context menu options to copy or donwload current page and a extension button with some menu to copy opened tabs or select some of them to copy and download as multip files"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user browsing the web, I want to convert web page content into well-formatted markdown so that I can save it for offline reading, share it with others, or provide it as context to AI language models for analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing a web page, **When** they right-click on the page, **Then** they see context menu options to copy the current page as markdown or download it as a markdown file
2. **Given** a user has multiple tabs open, **When** they click the extension button, **Then** they see a menu allowing them to copy all open tabs or select specific tabs to copy/download as markdown
3. **Given** a user selects "Copy as Markdown" from the context menu, **When** the conversion completes, **Then** the markdown content is copied to their clipboard with proper formatting preserved
4. **Given** a user selects "Download as Markdown" from the context menu, **When** the conversion completes, **Then** a markdown file is downloaded with an appropriate filename
5. **Given** a user selects multiple tabs to download, **When** they confirm the action, **Then** each tab is downloaded as a separate markdown file

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a page has dynamic content that loads after initial page load?
- How does system handle pages with restricted access or behind authentication?
- What happens when clipboard operations fail due to browser permissions?
- How does the extension handle very large pages that might exceed memory limits?
- What happens when a page cannot be converted due to complex layouts or scripts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Extension MUST provide context menu options when user right-clicks on any web page
- **FR-002**: Extension MUST offer both "Copy as Markdown" and "Download as Markdown" options in the context menu
- **FR-003**: Extension MUST convert visible page content to properly formatted markdown preserving headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
- **FR-004**: Extension MUST handle both server-side rendered (SSR) and client-side rendered (CSR) content
- **FR-005**: Extension MUST provide an extension button that displays a menu when clicked
- **FR-006**: Extension menu MUST allow users to copy markdown content from all currently open tabs
- **FR-007**: Extension menu MUST allow users to select specific tabs for copying or downloading
- **FR-008**: Extension MUST support batch downloading of multiple tabs as separate markdown files
- **FR-009**: Downloaded files MUST use the browser tab's title as the default filename (sanitized for file system compatibility)
- **FR-010**: Extension MUST provide clear feedback when operations complete successfully or fail
- **FR-011**: Extension MUST preserve important page structure including tables, code blocks, blockquotes, ordered/unordered lists, and nested content
- **FR-012**: Extension MUST handle images by linking to their original URLs in markdown format
- **FR-013**: Extension MUST use CommonMark specification as the default markdown format
- **FR-014**: Extension MUST handle pages of any size without imposed limits (browser memory constraints apply)
- **FR-015**: Extension MUST provide user-configurable settings including:
  - File naming pattern (tab title, URL domain, custom prefix/suffix, timestamp)
  - Image handling (link to URL, skip images, or download with markdown)
  - Markdown flavor selection (CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown, or minimal)
  - Content inclusion options (include/exclude comments, scripts, hidden elements)
  - Link handling (absolute URLs, relative URLs, or remove links)
  - Code block syntax highlighting preference
  - Table formatting style
  - Maximum heading level to preserve
  - Line width wrapping preference
  - Custom CSS selectors for content inclusion/exclusion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Web Page Content**: The HTML content of a webpage including text, images, links, and structural elements that need to be converted
- **Markdown Document**: The formatted output containing the converted page content in markdown syntax
- **Tab Selection**: User's choice of which browser tabs to process for conversion or download
- **User Preferences**: Configurable settings that control how content is converted, formatted, and saved
- **Conversion Profile**: A saved set of user preferences that can be quickly applied for different use cases
